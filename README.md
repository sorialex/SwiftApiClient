# SwiftApiClient

I was looking to write a new *API Client* to use in future projects.
Based on multiple articles talking about *using generics and enumerations to handle requests* and other resources on the Internet *using structs and enums for base clases*, im developing this.

**Configure new requests in an easy way, mapping and simple handling are a must here.**

*Using JSONPlaceholder(http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) as test backend.*
